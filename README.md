# 🛡️ learn-dsa: Systems-Oriented DSA in C++

This repository serves as a personal archive for my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey in C++ — with a focus on memory efficiency, systems programming, and low-level optimization.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each chapter is broken down into smaller sections (matching my study roadmap), and each section has its own `theory/` and `homework/`:
- `theory/` — Code written while following lectures, exploring concepts, and experimenting.
- `homework/` — Solutions to practice problems and coding challenges.

### 🔎 Chapter Scope (clarification)

Folder names are fixed for structural/design reasons, so here's what each chapter *actually* covers content-wise:

| Folder | Actual Scope |
|---|---|
| `01_Systems_Thinking` | Complexity analysis (Big-O), Recursion |
| `02_Searching_Sorting` | Search & Sort fundamentals |
| `03_Advanced_Sorting` | Advanced sorting, Divide & Conquer |
| `04_Linear_DS` | Linear data structures |
| `05_Hash_Tables_Strings` | Hash Tables, String algorithms |
| `06_Non_Linear_Trees` | Trees (incl. B-Tree, see dependency note below) |
| `07_Non_Linear_Graphs` | Graphs |
| `08_Advanced_Paradigms` | Advanced algorithmic paradigms |
| `09_Distributed_Infra` | **Infrastructure-oriented DSA only** (e.g. storage/indexing structures). Distributed *systems design* topics (Quorum, Vector Clocks, Gossip, 2PC) are explicitly **out of scope** here — that's a separate track. |

> ⚠️ **Dependency reminder:** `01/part_03` (Cache) is deferred and **must be revisited before `06.6` (B-Tree)** — B-Tree indexing concepts build on the cache material.
